\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classSquirrelMotionPlanner_1_1Planner}{Squirrel\-Motion\-Planner\-::\-Planner} \\*\hyperlink{classSquirrelMotionPlanner_1_1Planner}{Planner} class, used for 8dof planning from the current robot pose to a desired goal pose or end effector location. Uses a 2-\/stage planning approach that first searches for a 2\-D A$\ast$ path to the goal, shortens the path by a fixed distance, and then smoothens the path. The last pose is then used to find a full 8\-D plan that includes the arm movement }{\pageref{classSquirrelMotionPlanner_1_1Planner}}{}
